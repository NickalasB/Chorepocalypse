# Chorepocalypse

Chorepocalypse is a To-do app for all of the too-busy, too-distracted, or
too-lazy people in the world. Most task apps use a small, non-intrusive
notification icon coupled with a dainty "ding" to notify users.
Not Chorepocalypse!! When it's time to do your chores, **the app takes over
your screen and gives you a nice annoying alarm** to ensure you take notice and get your chores done!

## Set up
* To get this app up and running:
1. Clone this repo or download the zip file
2. Open up Android Studio and simply select "Import Project"
3. Once you've got that configured choose Run 'app' from the Run dropdown menu.

## Navigating the App
* **When you launch the app** you will be presented with an upper layout that will display
the details of your chores like:
1. Chore name
2. Photo of your chore
3. Chore due date
4. Chore approval status
5. Chore points

* Below that is a list of your chores showing
1. Chore name
2. Chore due date
3. Chore approval status
4. Chore points

* **To add a chore** just click on the floating action button wher you'll be taken to the **Add Chore**
screen. From there you can:
1. Give your chore a name
2. Set a deadline
3. Set a point value
4. Set whether or not your chore needs approval
5. Set a chore picture

_At the very least- every chore must have a name and a due date_

* **Once a chore is added**  you can add more or hit the back button to be taken to the home screen.
There you'll see your latest chore and chore details added to the chore detail screen as well as in
the chore list below.

_**To delete a chore** simply swipe a chore in the list to the left or right._


_**Clicking on any of the chores** in the list will update the chore
detail layout with the corresponding chore details._

* **Clicking the photo in the chore detail screen** will take you to a new screen where you will see
a full resolution image of your chore and a few other details like when youre chore is due and how
points it's worth.

### The good stuff
* **When your chore is due**, regardless of what you're distracting yourself with on your device,
you'll get a nice annoying, loud, full-screen reminder that it's time to _**get off your keister and
get your chore done!!**_

* **To dismiss the alarm** touch the picture and you'll see a button you can hit to confirm you got
the message. Hit the back button to be taken back to the home screen so you can add more chores.

### Extras
* **Home screen widget**- the app also comes with a home screen widget. To enable it just long-press
on your home screen and select the Chorepocalypse widget from the widget list.

_Clicking on a list item in the widget will open the app and navigate you to the full-screen chore
 image page_

##Future Features
* This is the initial release of this app so it has a way to go and  more features will be added including:

1. Firebase authentication so each user has their own database
2. Different user classes- _ie. parents/chore assigner and kids/chore do-ers_
3. The ablilty to assign chores to other users
4. Settings so users can chose alarms, view alarms,
